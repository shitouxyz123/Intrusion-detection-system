# Intrusion-detection-system
This project contains intrusion detection system where a neural network is trained to detect various types of attacks and compared with other classifiers
Steps to run this code:
To run this python files you have to install:
1) Keras and tensorflow library

About python files:
1) DatasetReduction contains the python code to reduce feature of dataset
2) Decision tree classifer is the python code to train and test on decision tree classifer
3) knn classifer is the python code to train and test on knn classifer
4) Naive bayes classifer is the python code to train and test on naive bayes classifer
5) Neural classifer is the python code to train and test on neural net classifer
6) SGD classifer is the python code to train and test on sgd classifer

Steps to run:
1) Give the path name of dataset where the dataset is stored in python code.
2) Give the destination path where you want to store the generated output files.

Dataset is available on this site:http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html
